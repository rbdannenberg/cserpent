CSerpent is an experimental compiler and runtime designed to compile Serpent programs (with slight changes to add minimal type declarations). A minimal proof-of-concept study suggests speedup of 25x (suggesting roughly 4x slower than C++) is possible without losing the character of Serpent (Python like) programming. See [Making Python Run Fast](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rbd/blog/fast/fast-blog10jan2024.html) for more information.
